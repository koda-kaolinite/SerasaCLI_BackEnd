## **Title: 0000 - Process: Recording Architecture Decisions**

**Date:** 2025-09-26

**Status:** `Accepted`

---

### **Context**

It is a good practice to formally document all application architecture decisions to ensure long-term maintainability
and knowledge sharing.

---

### **Decision**

For all architectural decisions, an Architecture Decision Log (ADL) will be maintained. All decisions will be recorded
as Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).

Each ADR will be a Markdown file created. We will use
the [Michael Nygard template](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions), which
includes the following sections: Status, Context, Decision, and Consequences.

---

### **Consequences**

- All architectural decisions must be recorded in the log. Old decisions should be recorded retroactively with an approximate decision date.
- New decisions must be recorded regularly.
